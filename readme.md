## About Alogfaeit

We designed and developed a representation of Geospatial festivals and events in Thailandusing Laravel Framework, a tool which has a MVC(Model-View-Controller) structure.  The  eventsinformation can  be  represented  in Geographic Information System (GIS)and we also identifythe  location  of  the  events with  Geolocation. The MediaWiki  Action  API,  a  web  servicewhich isprovided  in  Wikipedia was  used  to aggregate the text content for the description of the events.
